# USCBR
A gender-neutral bathroom map for the USC campus


Name of your app: UofSCBR

Team Members: Cooper DeStefano and Mallory Baskin

Abstract: This app is to help trans and non-binary identified USC students and anyone else find gender-neutral bathrooms on campus. Users will be able to see a map of campus, see routes to the nearest one, and set the app to their liking

Background: There are existing gender-neutral bathroom map apps, but none that are specific to our campus. The ones that do exist only list 3 of the ones on campus, rather than the 75 that are listed by the OMSA website.

The data we will be using for the map can be found here: https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/multicultural_student_affairs/student-support/lgbtq_resources/index.php

Seeing a map of campus with gender-neutral bathrooms marked

Being able to review bathrooms on campus
